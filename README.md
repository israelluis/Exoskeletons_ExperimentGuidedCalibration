# Exoskeletons & Experiment-guided parameter calibration
In this repository, we provide MatLab scripts to calibrate muscle-tendon parameters based on prior recorded data, and to simulate muscle-tendon dynamics based on assistive moment aka. ideal exoskeleton assistance. 
Further information about our study and computational methods can be found in the publications:
- Experiment-guided calibration of muscle fiber lengths and passive forces
- Springs vs. motors: Optimal assistance to support walking across speeds

This is a work in collaboration with researchers from VU Amsterdam. The scripts are derived from the muscle redundancy solver from KULeuvenNeuromechanics.
